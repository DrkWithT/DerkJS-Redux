## README

### Brief
My latest attempt at implmenting JavaScript under version ES5 in modern C++.

### Dependencies
 - LLVM 21.1.7+ (just the Homebrew distribution for now)
 - CMake 4.2+
 - Ninja

### Caveats
 - `use strict` is the locked default.
 - No automatic semicolon insertion.

### Grammar (Expressions)
```
<primary> = "undefined" | "null" | "this" | <identifier> | <boolean> | <number> | "(" <expr> ")"
<member> = <primary> ( "." <member> | "[" <expr> "]" )?
<new> = "new"? <member>
<call> = <new> "(" ( <expr> ( "," <expr> )* )? ")"
<unary> = ( "!" | "+" | "-" )? <call>
<factor> = <unary> ( ( "%" | "*" | "/" ) <unary> )*
<term> = <factor> ( ( "+" | "-" ) <factor> )*
<compare> = <term> ( ( "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" ) <term> )*
<equality> = <compare> ( ( "==" | "!=" | "===" | "!==" ) <compare> )*
<expr> = <call> ( "=" <equality> )?
```

### Grammar (Statements)
```
<program> = <stmt>+
<stmt> = <variable> | <return> | <function> | <expr-stmt>
<variable> = "var" <var-decl> ( "," <var-decl>)* ";"
<var-decl> = <identifier> ( "=" <expr> )?
<return> = "return" <expr> ";"
<function> = "function" <identifier> "(" ( <identifier> ( "," <identifier> )* )? ")" <block>
<block> = "{" <stmt>+ "}"
<expr-stmt> = <expr> ";"
```
